As a son with a single immigrant mother with a third grade education. As the President of our nation's finest legislative body.

More importantly, we reflect them in this incredible legislative body. The diversity of this body, age, race, gender, bilingualism, your background, whether your last name is Wilk or you have a few more syllables, like Wieckowski. We're a living breathing testament to the idea that California is a place where people celebrate, not castigate, their differences. For Senators you only sworn, I say to you and your loved ones, felicidades. Congratulations and for those returning Senators, thank you for the historic progress that we have made, that we have created together. If anything, this past election was a powerful reaffirmation of our collective work to make California a stronger, safer, more inclusive, and prosperous state. I want to acknowledge my Republican counterpart, Jean Fuller, for incredible public service, and for her incredible friendship. We have worked so well together, we will continue to work well together. Let's give it up, please, for my Republican counter, Jean Fuller and I want to say to all Senators here today, Democrats, as well as Republicans. We are part of the same California community and I can tell you this, the election is over, thank God. Welcome Mr. Wilk, to the Senate body and I can tell to all of you here today, I could not care less which side of the aisle you sit on. Only the quality of your ideas and values that you stand on and I look forward to working with each and every one of you and helping you make sure that Californians actually achieve their dreams. For my Democratic colleagues, we know that our majority serves at the pleasure. At the pleasure of the people, and will only be super if we lead responsibly, remain fiscally prudent, and deliver a fact on our promises. Even after our legislative session of extraordinary accomplishments there is still much work to be done. Chief and perhaps most immediate among them is transportation and infrastructure. As powerful as California's economy is and it's the fifth largest economy in the world, our system doesn't work if Californians can not get to work. No matter what else we accomplish together. If we don't comprehensively address the needs of the lack of investment and affordable housing, in our chroming roads, our bridges, our parks, our water resources, it will continue to be a drag on the quality of life of our communities. In the coming weeks and the months, this institution will once again be a conveyor belt of bold ideas for California's most pressing priorities. We have much to do over the next two years. And the voters have elected the right women and the right men to do the job and yet, I can say this when the success of this session is actually ultimately measured, our most important role might be as check and balance. See, California is the last rock before the continent gives way to the ocean. We have always represented a future for restless Americans, a land of what could be. Now this body has been called to service at a pivotal and some would say, a portentous, moment in our state's and nation's history. In their wisdom, our constituents have sent us here with a very clear and overwhelming mandate to continue making California the truest embodiment of the American dream, where people of all races, religions, and backgrounds can live in safety, attend excellent schools, access public health, breathe clean air into their lungs, and contribute to one of the most powerful economies in the world. At the same time, we confront a dichotomy of democracy, unique in our history where the most overt opponents of our State of states Through public declarations appears to be the incoming head of states and although our President-elect lost a popular vote and 4 million more Californians voted for his opponents, he will be our President. We hold the highest reverence for that office regardless of whose name is on that desk, but also know, that our democratic and federal assistance were designed by our founders, to endure to be bigger, than any one election or any one executive. Many Californians, some tongue in cheek and some hand and hearts had advocated withdrawal with America no state ever succeeds by seceding. So we will be clear. California will accept the election results as we always do. California will adhere to the Constitution as we always do, but California will never appease to those who threaten to undermine our prosperity or deprive our people their most fundamental human rights. We refuse to recess, regress back to the politics of scapegoating, praying on religious, racial, and ethic hostilities, echoing the dark, divisive days of Proposition 187. We will always fight for what is right. We will always fight for our California values, in a bipartisan fashion, as we always do. Senators let me say, the hallmark of this house has always been about policy leadership emulated across the nation and renowned around the world. But this group of Senators, each and every one of you, Republicans and Democrats alike, carry the additional and urgent obligation of moral leadership. More than ever it's vital that we ensure that California continues to be America's exceptional example. A beacon of hope and opportunity in an uncertain world. That we double down on lifting people up. That we defend our people and our progress and that we continue to be a world leader on workers' rights, womens' rights, voting rights, civil rights, social justice, economic justice, climate action, environmental protection and access to healthcare and public education for everyone irrespective of who you are and where you come from. So let me conclude as I began, with a message to our constituents, the people of California, especially those who perhaps were bullied at one time, demeaned, or downsized, or told that they're dispensable because they're different. California has always been the place where you can be whoever you are and become whoever you dream of being. That's a principle which has always been bigger than politics or partisanship and there are 40, 40 exemplary Californians on this floor here today who represent both sides of the political spectrum, who I know are ready to stand up and speak out for each and every one of you. Now California has endorsed all of you here today with their votes and have entrusted each and every one of you with their future. And we will not let you down. My fellow Californians, we will not let you down by backing down, not now, not ever. I am proud of this robust bipartisan body. We always have vigorous debates all the time, but it's always carried in such a manner that's congenial and respectful. The power of dialog in debate and let the votes always carry the day with the votes and the people of the State of California. To my Republican colleagues, to my Democratic colleagues, let's get to work. Thank you very much, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thank you. Colleagues, it is indeed an honor for me to recognize my counterpart, the leader of the Republican caucus of the California State Senate, and my very good friend, Senator Jean Fuller.\n",
      "[00:11:56] Jean Fuller: \n",
      "\tI would like to start by thanking all of you for bringing your good will and your love for the State of California with you today. I would also like to thank our Pro-Tem Kevin De Leon for the wonderful experience he's given all of us the last few years of his leadership and I'm looking forward to continuing that. We've been good friends, we worked on many issues together and my background too is similar. My parents brought me home from the hospital to a train car, that's what we lived in in the back of their parents' home and again, this is not about that, but is is about the fact that all of us can be whatever we can be in this state if we dedicate ourselves to helping others, to loving the state, and to debating with one another what the best policies would be. I feel that I have been so privileged to come from a dust bowl baby to here and to work with all of you today and soon I'll be saying goodbye and letting the younger ones take over and it feels really, really good because I trust all of you and this tradition that we've developed together. So today is a special day and I would like to personally welcome all of the Senators being sworn in with their family and friends. I would like to say that our shared experience as California State Senators will last us a lifetime. No one else will experience that things that we have experienced or know what it feels like to be In these chairs and so I'm starting my thoughts today with a thank you for the collegial experiences that we will all share and the rich friendships that we have developed. Just as Kevin and I have been able to develop a great friendship around educational policy and other issues through the years, each of us will have a chance to work with one another and develop a special relationship that no one else will share. I'd like to specifically recognize the newest members of our Republican caucus, Senator Scott Wilk, and congratulate our caucus members who were reelected this year, Senator Ted Gaines, Senator Mike Morrell, and Senator John Moorlach and to all of the rest of you I can't wait to get a chance to know you better and work with you and some of you I've been blessed already to have gotten to know some of your ideas and I love all of your idealism. This day also marks the beginning of our new legislative session. The next two years will present us with opportunities to address many of the challenges facing hardworking Californians and I'm looking forward to working together to help all areas of our state through the solutions that promote economic opportunity, jobs, and making California more affordable. While both sides of the aisle will find areas of agreement we will also passionately debate our ideas, but what makes this chamber so special is that we can disagree and yet we are collegial and show every member the respect they deserve because they were chosen by the people. As a member of the State of California and as a representative of our constituents we are bestowed the honor of carrying on the tradition of civility that was set before us. I look forward to continuing to work closely with the Pro-Tem and all the Senators to do that, but I look back in appreciation for the past practice and the historic tradition of stability and collegiality that we all know is the California State Senate's legacy to us and so it is a privilege to serve with all of you. As we strive, all of us in our own way, and in our unique advocacy for our unique districts, do great things for this state and thank you for helping us all be the members that can do that.\n",

      "\tThank you very much, Madam President. Colleagues, members, Senate Resolution number 7, reaffirms our commitments to protecting and serving California's immigrant communities. With this measure we honor our American heritage by recognizing that we are and always have been a nation of immigrants. This nation was founded on the principles of freedom and opportunity as a refuge for the oppressed and the persecuted and those seeking a better life. In California, we recognize that our immigrant communities are vital to our prosperity. Undocumented Californians represent up to one-tenth of our total work force. They are hardworking, upstanding members of our society who contribute billions of dollars to our economic activity and tax revenue to our state each year. This resolution, Senate resolution number seven urges Congress and the President-elect to develop rational immigration policies, that recognize the contributions of immigrants to the nation, protect the economy, and treat immigrant families and children humanely, with a modicum of dignity and respect. Specifically, a request that the President-elect continue President Obama's deferred action for childhood arrivals programme commonly known as DACA. It denounces unjustified mass deportation plans and declares our support for comprehensive reforms to our broken immigration system. We ask this in a bipartisan fashion, we ask that the Congress of the United States, in a bipartisan fashion move forward with a comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship that again underscores the necessity of the vital contributions that immigrants make to the great State of California. Colleagues, I respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n",

      "[00:04:40] Ben Hueso: \n",
      "\tThank you Madam President, the Vice Chair of the California Latino Legislative Caucus. I send in strong support of this resolution as the son of an immigrant standing in a Senate Floor full of the sons and daughters of immigrants not only to the state, but to this country I ask that we all stand in concert to up hold the values that have made this country great. As a representative of one of this country's most diverse states I think it is important that we stand together place a value on the diversity that has brought so much success to California. We stand beside every one that has made a contribution to make our state the number one economy in the United States and the fifth or sixth largest economy in the world. We are working hard to provide prosperity for all. In a community that supports inclusion, that supports of creating a strong fabric of society, of a community that supports keeping families together, a community that supports of everything that diversity of this world has to contribute to the meaningful improvement of our state. Many people in our community are afraid of what looms in the horizon and it's important that, early on, California take a position to send a message that California stands ready. To represent all the members of our community that are contributing to make California a success. Just in particular to undocumented immigrants, I want to note that as mentioned, they comprise nearly 10% of the state's workforce, contributing $130 billion annually to its Gross Domestic Product. They pay their fair share of taxes, and according to data from the Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants in California paid over 2.2 billion in state and local taxes in 2010, including 1.8 billion in sales tax. 152.1 million in state income taxes and 302.8 million in property taxes. The Bay largely comprises some of California's largest and most dynamic industries, such as the agricultural industry, as we know.  The tourist industries in California and what would our state be without this workforce? Yet, there is fear that there can be serious damages to these families, to these members, to our state, to our economy and to the communities that we have worked so hard to forge. So, I want to thank the pro tem for moving forward this resolution and I urge the Senate to embrace this policy and send this message to Washington. That California is doing things the right way and we're very happy with the direction of our state. Thank you.\n",

It's important in a moment like this that we stand united in support of immigrants, in support of diversity, and all that they contribute to our society and I strongly urge an aye vote on Sr 7.\n",

      "[00:08:56] Joel Anderson: \n",
      "\tSenators, this floor has voted time and time again unanimously to support a path to citizenship. We've never said that we want to stop adversity, we all understand that having people come to our nation, and participate in our society makes us stronger, gives us more fiber in the social fabric and that's a good thing and, we've never condoned the exploitation of somebody here whether legally or illegally. We've always believed, on this floor, I've never seen a vote, I've never seen someone stand up against human rights. In fact, we've come together each and every time, but the subtle racism of this bill like SCA5 goes too far, you see there are people in my district who've been waiting a long time to become US citizen. And they patiently waited on line and they did exactly what we told them to do, and what this resolution does it says it doesn't matter how long you've waited, it doesn't matter that you paid attention to the rules, that you followed the law, that you want to participate in our citizenship and be a good steward and citizen of our country. It says, even if you violate our sovereignty, even if you choose to start off by breaking our laws, you're every bit as important or more important and you should have priority over those who waited patiently in line. Now, I'd love for us to take up, SJA1, by our colleague from Central Valley. That's a bi-partisan effort that would bring us all together and we all could support and we could set off the right tone, but we saw in the propositions, that the people voted for Proposition 54, which adds more transparency to this floor. This resolution that came in today was put across the floor this morning. We didn't have time to sit down and talk across party lines, and say look let's change the language a little bit so we all can support it. So, we all can send a clear and balanced message to the Trump administration that we want to work together for a common goal. Now, this was a hyperpartisan move to try to put Republicans and others who want to support a path to citizen for all, for citizens who follow the law. It's to embarrass them, it's to embarrass the Trump administration. I don't see, and I know you have a super majority and I'm in the super minority, but I don't see how this is in the best interest of this body on this celebratory day, where we bring new members, and the first thing we do is a partisan bill. So, I urge that you vote no on this, that we bring up SCA or SJA, I guess it's SJA 1, so we would have a bipartisan bill that we all could support. That unites us and not divides us, I urge a no vote.\n",

      "\tThank you Madam President, Senators. I am pleased to stand in strong support of Sr 7. As a son of immigrants, and I know many of you here are children of immigrants and some are even immigrants themselves. This is, I think, an extremely important statement about what California's values are and the need, really, for a fix to our very dysfunctional immigration system. That's why my good colleague mentioned that, that's why we've supported a path to citizenship because, unfortunately, right now the law, that doesn't exist and, in fact, part of our challenge is that there have been statements made that are of significant concern to our fellow residents here in California. I think that, and particularly, I think one part of the resolution I think is particularly important which has not been touched on. It's related to the DACA immigrants and I will tell you that, certainly as a pediatrician who takes care of children, you have children who were brought over through no particular, wasn't their choice or their decision, who grew up as Californians, as Americans and to talk about, well, they need to go to the back of the line or that nature really doesn't make sense because they are Americans, they grew up in America and to tell them that, well you need to go back to whatever country your parents brought you from, and tell you that, and stand in line really doesn't make sense, and frankly, actually diminishes us, the rest of us, because they are helping contribute to our communities. Now the other thing I also want to mention, certainly as a member of the API caucus is that Asian Pacific Islanders are the largest now immigrant group here in California In fact, I would point out that the Chinese Americans were actually the first illegal immigrants. Some people say the original illegal immigrants to the United States because what happened is that here in this country we had passed an unjust law banning the immigration of all Chinese and then Asians to this country, including California. So the Chinese then came to Mexico and then crossed the border into California and that's because of an unjust law that was in existence here in the United States. Fortunately our country eventually, it took a few decades, just corrected that wrong and allowed Immigrants again to come from China and from Asia and thankfully, my parents had the opportunity after World War Two to do so. And were able to come to this country. So in the absence of action at the federal level to address the problems we have in our immigration system, we do need to protect those of our fellow residents here in California who are contributing to our communities and we do need to make a statement that the people of California and this legislative body will ask and fight for them and also ask our fellow government, certainly not act in a way that would be damaging to our communities, and our state. So I urge again, an aye vote on SR 7 thank you.\n",

      "\tThank you very much Madam President and let me add this take a brief moment to welcome all of my new colleagues to the red carpet and I would argue that today is the perfect day. The absolute most appropriate day as we all begin our collective experiences serving the people of the great State of California for the 2017-2018 legislative session that this is indeed the day that we have thorough debate and discussion on the issue that has indeed become the elephant in the living room of our nation. Having served in this body now for two, three years, I've had the opportunity to hear on numerous occasions, as a Budget Committee member, policy Committee Member, the issue around DACA, and I've heard directly from the young people who are impacted by that program. Because of that experience because of my belief in their future and my belief in the responsibility we as a state owe to that population of young people, I'm proud to stand in support of SER7, but most importantly, wanted to say that given the critical nature of these issues contained in this resolution, and their impact on the State of California, today is the day, colleagues, newly elected and those of us who are returning, to put our stake in the sand. To communicate our message, our belief system as a body to the incoming administration with regard to our belief in Doca and the related programs. I stand in support of SCR 7, SR 7.\n",

      "\tThank you very much. Madam President, I wasn't going to speak, but I do want to address the point that was raised about partisanship, because I think it's important and I think the Senator from San Diego that raised his point, his important message, but I just want to say this, that I think that it would be imprudent not to recognize, Madam President, the sensitivities, for whatever reasons, without regard to partisanship, that occurred as a result of the Presidential contest. The effect of that at the deepest human level was fear. Was it rational? Are these policies going to be implemented or not? Who knows? But what you have are a whole host of people without resources Without sophistication. Without access to lawyers and government and all of the stuff that you do to defend yourself that are worried and so I think on a bipartisan basis, if you look at this, there's no names mentioned. I looked at it very closely. I was thinking about whether or not to do it for those very reasons because I think particularly both on this day, but also on the nature of this issue is that it really is something that sends a message to so many people in California that we're going to fight for you, that we think about you, that there are people in power that you've never met in your life that care and are sensitive to who you are and what's going on. That's the message and that is a bipartisan message and so I just stand here today because I think for all of us irrespective of party this is such an important contextual message to send in a thoughtful gracious and elegant way. That's why I'm supporting it, that's why I signed onto this and that's why I think everybody today unanimously should stick together and make the statement with that level of respect and sensitivity for the human condition.\n",

      "\tLast year, members, I had a form on wage theft in my district and I invited our community to attend the forum. I was astounded by the hundreds and hundreds of people that showed up, and one by one told of the exploitation, people working on literally pennies on the hour in terms of wages. I also heard housing discrimination, employment discrimination and it was all based on the fact that people that have undocumented status can be exploited and I think we have to talk about that from a moral context. People that have undocumented status are vulnerable to being exploited and the way they're exploited in is some of the basic American rights that we have for fair housing, non-discrimination, the Constitution of the United States and the State of California. And the question is then become on a moral context and a political context, it's not a partisan issue, but shall we let people be exploited? And what we claim our Constitution says in terms of civil rights, will we allow people to be exploited and cheated to such an extent that they're paid pennies on the dollar, that they're exploited in terms of their housing, exploited in all manners of our society in California or do we want to see changes in the laws that end that exploitation? That create an environment where we can have liberty and justice for all? And I urge support of this resolution. To me, I will never stand for the status quo because I think it's a cancer on our society in California. It's a cancer, this whole thing where we can say that we believe in liberty and justice for all and we can believe in all those civil rights laws that we all believe in, yet we do not want to deal with that particular issue when it comes to people that are undocumented immigrants and I think we have to stand for our Constitution, we have to stand for our moral values. Please let's get together and all support this resolution. I think all the people of our state deserve this and let them know what you stand for.\n",

      "\tThank you Madam President. First I want to welcome the new members to this incredible institution and I regret today that it should be a time of celebration when we bring people together, and our first piece of business is going to be one that is going to be rather divisive. During the presidential campaign, a few things were highlighted, one of them was law and order and I'm also a product of a family that had immigrants that came over from Poland, came over from Russia, came from Canada and this presidential election touched a nerve across this country. I'll call them the forgotten souls of this country that felt that their voice hasn't been heard and were inspired by our president-elect and brought millions of people who never registered to vote to actually come out and vote. I can't support the resolution because I can't support sanctuary cities. How many more Kate Steinles of the world are we going to have? Why is there nothing in this resolution that criticizes the President of the United States, Obama, who has probably deported more citizens out of this country than any other President in our history and yet we're already criticizing a President who hasn't even taken the oath of office yet. My friends, this President is going to control a lot of federal funding that flows into this state and I think that approving this type of a resolution, before he even takes the office, is going to be a blunder. It's going to be very critical of a man that was duly elected President of the United States. That could put this state in financial harm, in financial jeopardy, if the existing funds that come through our state coffers suddenly cease. I would prefer to work on a resolution that is in the spirit of the Proposition we just passed that says that things must be 72 hours in print, to bring people together, to bring Republicans and Democrats together with a common theme that we value immigrants in our country. We value immigrants in the State of California. I certainly value them in my county, Riverside. We have a strong agricultural county. A service industry that depends on their great work and dedication. So I hope that we try to work harder, to have real debate on this floor, to bring people together and to compromise in the spirit of congeniality that we have always carried as a tradition on this Senate Floor. For those reasons, my fellow colleagues, I recommend a no vote.\n",

      "[00:13:27] Mike Morrell: \n",
      "\tSenator Morrell, thank you. It's good to be back, and it's good to see all of you guys today. A lot of good things I read in that resolution from our Senator, thank you very much, but a couple of the comments on the floor I just don't want to get past us. They talked about, one of my friends from San Jose talked about constitutionalism and what all that means. Going back to the actual immigration policies, America's the first nation not founded by a race, nor was it founded by territories. It was founded by immigrants, but there was only one type of person that was supposed to be here, and that was an American person and when Lincoln said it's Americanists, the glue that holds us together, are people having a thorough knowledge of the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence. He said that's the electric cord which binds us together and so some of the things that are said here today are not constitutional, we should stick to that, and that's why we have laws, the rule of laws and we don't want to usurp those rule of laws as our President has. Not going to pick on him today because he only has a few more weeks to go out, but I think we have to restore that rule of law and have orderly immigration and so I don't want to be particularly picking on the President this time and so I just wanted to speak my piece, and remind everybody that I think as Americans we welcome people who want to come here. I do. I welcome people who want to come to United States, but I want those people who are going to pledge their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor to our country, and our fellow countrymen and not everybody who comes here wants to do that. So there's gotta be a process that doesn't overwhelm us but one that is orderly, and that they understand that they're willing to pledge everything for this country because it's such a wonderful country. Thank you.\n",

      "\tThank you Madam President and members. I want to commend first of all our pro-tem for bringing this timely resolution to our chamber and to our floor. As hundreds of thousands of immigrants in California are honestly scared and are looking to us for some sort of hope, some [FOREIGN], that they are going to be able to be okay in this country and I also stand here as a proud anchor baby. As somebody who came, whose both parents came here illegally. They were undocumented immigrants, but this is what happens when people are hungry. This is what happens when people do not have a future. They sacrifice everything to come to this amazing country of ours. And I've always said this, and I'm so proud, that I am the proud son of an immigrant seamstress and an immigrant farm worker that now serves in the beautiful State of California, but I also want to be unequivocal, members, that if anyone tries to undermine the progress we have made in California to incorporate our immigrant communities. We should be proud of the fact that now hundreds of thousands of undocumented Children Now have access to full scope medical. Members we made that happen here and I want to be very resolute that if anyone, any Congress or incoming administration wants to dissolve the work that we have done in this great state. We are going to fight you in this Legislator. We are going to fight you in our courts and yes, we're going to fight you in the streets. We're going to organize and we're going to mobilize to ensure that we protect our most vulnerable Californians and members, for those of us that have immigrant parents or knew immigrants to this country, that come from nothing. The fight is real, the fight is real every day so we're used to fighting. We're used to coalescing and bonding together to protect ourselves, and that is what we're going to do. This is what my parents taught me, to respect everyone but when we are attacked we have to fight back and many people in this state are looking towards us to ensure that we protect the safe parts that we have put in this state to incorporate every Californian regardless of your immigration status. And so I'm proud to stand here as the son of immigrants, as a proud Californian, as a proud American, to declare that we are going to fight, we are not going to sit here, now is the time to roll up our sleeves, unite on behalf of our most vulnerable Californian members. I respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n",

      "\tNice way to start our session so colleagues I happen to be an immigrant. As our President protium is kind enough to remind me from time to time, I'm really blessed. I immigrated with my folks in 1960 from the Netherlands and we had to wait a long time to get our formation and we went to the process and we're here. When it comes to immigration I really appreciate this resolution and I understand what it's trying to do. I just, I'm just having trouble with some of the language and that's where I'd like to speak if we're debating. I think the Federal Government has really let the State of California and other border states down. I think this state has done an incredible job of huddling the masses. We're providing education, we're providing health care. We're even giving them driver's licenses and I see that our Secretary of State is here, we're even given them voter registration forms, but the federal government and what it may do and what it will do is pure conjecture at this point and so we're reacting to what we think might be coming and I don't know if that's the right approach. I think cooler heads should prevail. I'm not comfortable with saying we will fight, although I understand it, but I think we need to work with this administration. I think we need to get professional. I think we need to get in front of it. I think we need to build delegation. I think we need to do what we can to reach out in Basadorly. We need to tell them that whatever is done, you've gotta fix your own mistakes first and then we've gotta do what's proper and we have to do it in a humane manner. We should be collaborative. I don't think defiance is the right approach. That's the tone I'm proceeding. It may be good showmanship but it's poor leadership, but we need to lead at this time for those in our state. So colleagues, let's show the nation how we assimilate. Let's work together, let's be collaborative. Let's request some grace and compassion on this critical issue for our state and the rest of the nation and until there's an amendment, I'm uncomfortable with the resolution, but I duly respect what's behind it but I think we can do a little better. I urge a no vote, thank you Madam President.\n",

      "\tAny further debate or discussion? Senator Fuller.\n",
      "[00:22:24] Jean Fuller: \n",
      "\tI just would sort of like to say this was a time for all us to remember we're celebrating. This is a time for all of us to remember that we're starting anew together. This is a time that generally we have enjoyed our friends and the expectation because there's no time to process things before this because this is sort of the first day we get together because there's been no session. That perhaps this is a little premature for all of us to try to be bi-partisan and come to consensus because consensus takes time, it takes discussion and while it is true we know your beliefs and you know our beliefs, I think we all in here want to fix this problem. I think we've though it was going to be fixed in 2008, yet it wasn't and now we're here and it's going to be more difficult than ever before and it's more controversial and more complex than ever before. So, I, today, would like to clarify my position, so you will know how I feel about this. I, today, think that because we haven't had the time to process because we haven't had the consensus, time to build consensus, and because policy direction is maybe changing. Maybe it's going another way and that adds new complexities to what we, as a group, need to do to attack those issues. If it's to be a bipartisan effort, we need to give ourselves those tools. Maybe it would be wise for us to think about giving ourselves a little bit of a gift of time, a little bit of space. So today I support the efforts that we pass together in the past and by partisan support of SJR2 Vidak 2015 and SJR8 Correa 2014, I say let's build on that spirit. Unfortunately, today I will fold my vote until we have the time to build on that spirit in the future and to actually see, the policy that comes out of Washington to see if it changes to see if what the facts are that we will be debating because I hate for us to argue over our fears, thank you.\n",

Colleagues, first of all, let me say what a deep honor it is to be a member of this body and to serve with each of you on both sides of the isle, and I look forward to working together. I'll be honest, I was not intending to speak today. I was going to subscribe to the mantra that is, as a new member, I should be quite for awhile and I had every intent to do that until indirectly my great City of San Francisco's name was taken in vain due to our terrible tragedy that happened there, a tragedy that was used to demonize immigrant communities. Around the country despite the fact that we know that our immigrant communities have lower rates of crime than other communities do, despite the fact that our immigrant communities make us stronger not weaker. I'll be honest, that I really do believe that this resolution is highly timely. I, until a few minutes ago, was a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and in local government, when people don't know where to go, they email or contact their local elected official and in the days after this election, the number of emails and Facebook messages I received, and people stopping me on the street. People I did not even know, were undocumented. Saying to me I am scared and I do not know what to do. I don't know what's going to happen to my family. I don't know what's going to happen to me. It was just extraordinary to me, people I did not even know that either they were undocumented or someone in their family was undocumented or they had employees. Who are undocumented, and it is absolutely the right time for this body, for this legislator to step forward and to say, if you are going to come for our immigrant communities, you're going to come through us first and so I will proudly support this resolution.\n",

      "\tSo we know that the new President won't take his oath till January 20th. We know that we come back to the Legislature in January. So that gives us a window of opportunity. Nothing's going to happen before the 20th. Would you consider withdrawing this motion and allowing us to work together in a bipartisan manner? Because we all recognize that this is a very important subject and that we want to send a clear signal that citizens of California should not be scared, should not worry that we're not going to protect them, that we're not going to work on their behalf and we've come together time and time again when it's come to human rights. There's never in the 10 years I've been elected to the Legislature has there ever been a vote against a human rights bill. No matter who the author was nobody every voted against him. We have voted time and time again over the last three, four years on bills talking about a path to citizenship that have been offered by Dems and Republicans.  So I ask on you today to consider including all of us in this debate instead of dropping the resolution and forcing us to vote on it. When not one voice on this floor said that you're on the wrong path. They just simply didn't like the language. So I'm asking that you include us in your tent and allow us to be part of the solution. By withdrawing today instead of forcing it down our throats and forcing a vote that's going to have some no votes that's going to give more fear to those in San Francisco and other places because they're going to believe that there are members of this floor that want to hold people down. There's nobody on this floor that I'm aware of, that wants to hold people down, that wants to devalue what they bring to our community. We all want to root for those people and send a clear signal. So allow us please Mr. President Potam to be part of the solution with you, and don't deny us that opportunity. Please consider tabling this and allowing us to work together. We have those first two weeks, three weeks in January to really pound this out, and you'll have my commitment, and my pledge and I think if you were to ask for a show of hands, there's not a Republican that wouldn't raise his hand. So that's my request, and my question to you. Will you accept that as a potential answer?\n",

      "\tThank you very much Madam President, and I want to be careful I don't get into a colloquy right now with the fine gentleman from San Diego. county. I would ask that those who perhaps are not supportive of this measure or perhaps have the reservation with some measure. I would invite them to join us in an informed and support for this measure. It is December 5th and I do respect our Republican leader, Ms. Fuller and I do want to recognize here as well to for the rape congenial debate in that we've had on her. Trust me colleagues, those who haven't been here for quite a long time there was a time here then a debate on this issue we would have books and laptops lying from left to right and right to left. And heated passion arguments but some of on both sides of you all that go perhaps a little too far, but I want to thank our fine and Republican leader for statesmanship of this republican caucus, my colleagues, but this is a timely issue. The reason why I say this is I want to underscore a point that the Senator for Los Angeles had made a few moments ago. Is that for the first time in history, we sense great panic, anxiety among many communities throughout California, but for the very first time when you see a five year old child, a six year old child, a seven year old, an eight year old child in tears, broken because they're fearful, not to be part of some rather factual. They're broken, because they fear an individual who will occupy the most powerful position on planet Earth, that they're deeply concerned and worried. Anxiety, that perhaps when they come back from school, their mother may not be there or perhaps when they are being drop off at school or being rushed to the public hospital emergency room at the clinic, that someone may be waiting for him or her and this is real, it's not passion show, it's factual. We've taken pains, when you read Senate Resolution number seven, not to be partisan, but rather factual to be very clear and I would invite my colleagues, I understand some of my colleagues may have concerns about this resolution. I would probably beg to differ and say that, no matter how perfect it may be, I don't believe this would be a unanimous vote, but that's okay, because in a thriving democracy that is the United States of America and California, the most diverse mosaic on planet earth, we don't have to walk together lockstep, in unison together. I appreciate my colleague's perspective and viewpoints from Orange County. I jokingly say with much affection and respect, the Dutchman, you know when he came here with those wooden clogs, I knew he wasn't from America, as soon as I saw that, you know and they say this with much affection that he comes here to America and California and to Orange County. Janet Nguyen, excuse me apologize, Madame President, our fine colleague from Orange County. Just amazing contributors to the body politic of who we are as Californians. Irrespective if you're a Republican or a Democrat. Or immigrants from Detroit, Michigan who come here to California and contribute to the wonderful cultural life of who we are. Spending time together in Mexico City and elsewhere as we did. Really understanding the political nuances of that country. The push, pull migration factors to the United States, but something is real. It's happening right now, as we speak. January 20th can't wait. This resolution will be delivered to the Congress of the United States. Mr. Paul Ryan, as well as Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, as well as the incoming leader of the Senate, Charles Schumer, as well as the President-elect. It'll be on his desk waiting come January 20th. I hope it's on his desk and I hope he reads it and I hope he understands that California is a willing partner. We're willing to find common ground, but we will protect and defend the values of this state and most importantly its human capital, its citizens. We have no other choice as Democrats as well as Republicans. This is a wonderful debate to kick off December 5th. It is a celebratory day that we will continue to celebrate the election and re-election of the newest members as well as the returning members coming back here today. This is an important issue that we must take head-on. We cannot deviate from this course. Lastly I would say is this, and again, I appreciate this bipartisan dialogue, debate that we're having here today. Lastly, any political vendetta, retribution against the fifth largest economy on planet earth, $2.44 trillion GDP, 13% of America's economy, would help undermine America's economy because we are the economic engine that drives this nation. So anyone who doesn't like a position we take, who says all of a sudden I'll have a political vendetta and I'll come after you and I'll send federal agents for you that withhold healthcare for young children and senior citizens, and their lunches. We've gotta think about that because that's what I heard today too. One thing that's more powerful than funding formulas and dollars and laws are values. Values that we adhere to as Californians, Democrats, Republicans and those that are agnostic all together and that's why we stand together. I believe in unison even if it's not going to be a unanimous vote today. Again, I want to thank the Republican leader today for a congenial vote. Colleagues I respectfully ask for an aye vote.\n",

      "\tThank you, Mr. Speaker and members. A few moments ago I said that California is in a fight and that's true on a wide range of issues. Perhaps none more than immigration, which the President-elect has promised his base he would tackle on day one. So on our day one, we're introducing HR4. While we don't yet know what specific harm the next administration's proposals will cause, we do have a rough idea of what we're dealing with. We have all heard the insults, we have all heard the lies, and we have all heard the threats. Boxers say that when you're preparing for a fight one of the first things you work on is your stance. This resolution lays out our stance. Immigrants are part of California's history, our culture, and our society. Immigrants pay taxes, sometimes more than billionaires. Immigrants help drive the engine that makes California the sixth largest economy in the world. Immigrants matter in California. With HR 4 we are telling the next administration and Congress if you want to get to them, you have to go through us. 75 years ago.\n",

      "\tThank you, Mr. Speaker. Ladies and gentlemen, today is traditionally a joyous and a festive day, where we invite our family members and our friends to come and share in our experience of being sworn into office. Some of us sworn back into office, but it seems we've taken a swift departure from that joyous occasion by the resolution that is before us today. This resolution is not only inappropriate, but it's rather hippocratic. Our president-elect has yet to assume office, he doesn't even take office for 46 days and already we have a resolution that seeks to flare up tensions between communities and make accusations of things that haven't even been done yet. He's not in office yet. I want to put this into perspective for you, since there are so many here who were so supportive of President Obama. President Obama in the history of this country has deported more illegal immigrants than any other President and not one person in here has spoken up against that, not one. So I'm sorry, but the hypocrisy is astounding. The Customs and Immigration, their report says that President Obama has deported nearly 3 million immigrants. Nearly 3 million and we have a President-elect who never said he was going to form internment camps. I mean, come on, listen, there is campaign and then there is actually governing. Okay, many people and many of you in this room have said things during your campaign that you didn't act on when you got to office or you won't act on when you get into office. I suspect the same Is true for when someone runs for President. What I do know is that the President elect has said very clearly that his focus is going to be on the criminal elements that has invaded some of our communities. The criminal elements that is terrorizing the very immigrant communities and residents that we all want to protect and represent. So I don't want to hear anything about rounding people up, about internment camps, about going back to the days of World War II, because I don't believe that that's going to happen and I don't think you do either. I think this is an attempt for a sound bite, for a headline and what I'm suggesting is that we work together, Democrats and Republicans alike, and we come up with a solution to immigration. We come up with some comprehensive reform that we can represent and say look, California is home to the most immigrants in the country, here are suggestion. But the way to solve this problem isn't to argue and bicker and launch grenades on the first day of session. I think we're better than that. I think we may have differing opinions on what type of reform we need to enact, but I think we all agree that we need to enact some reform. So I'm asking you to reject this proposal and make a commitment to work with one another to come up with a solution that makes sense. Our President-elect, his claim, his goal was he said he wanted to make America great again. I think we all want the same thing, thank you.\n",
      "[00:06:16] Kevin Mullin: \n",
      "\tThank you, Mrs. Melendez. Mister, members, members, I would ask that there be no applause from the floor, no applause from the gallery we are in the midst of debate on a resolution. Mister Levine you are recognized.\n",
      "[00:06:34] Marc Levine: \n",
      "\tThank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I rise in support of HR 4, which recognizes the value of immigrants in California and seeks to provide vitally needed protections from President-elect Trump's proposed deportation policies. We have to call this policies by their name. Any policy with the framework of deporting a specific ethnic group of people is ethnic cleansing. A debate on this floor about whether this resolution has been in print long enough is insensitive to Californians who are living in fear. Of being deported under the Trump regime. I urge members to instead focus on our humanity and the real life implications of what President-elect Trump is proposing. Six months ago, I introduced two resolutions, which are very similar to HR 4, and those resolutions were never heard. Who at that time would have thought that this great nation would elect a xenophobe to lead the free world? Nonetheless, we now recognize the reality of the potential deportation of family, friends, neighbors, children in school. Members of our community, we have to accept that Trump has been elected President. And we can no longer be silent, nor complicit. We must take President-elect Trump at his word and assume he will pursue the ethnic cleansing policies he has been espousing. I thank Mr. Speaker for bringing this measure forward, and I respectfully ask for an aye vote. Thank you Mr. Levine.\n",

      "\tThank you, Mr. Speaker and colleagues. I rise that the chair of the Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus and as a coauthor of HR4. Immigration is critical to keeping alive the American dream. The dream that the United States is the land of opportunity for people from all over the world. Many of us and our families have lived that dream ourselves. My mother, Cynthia, is an immigrant from the Philippines. She's actually here today, sitting above us in the gallery over there. I was born in the Philippines, and I came here as a baby and we built our lives as a family here in California. I feel that I've been very blessed to be given the opportunity to come to this country, to be educated by our fantastic California public school system and to rebuild our lives and eventually to become a public servant, serving Californians. And we need to ensure that opportunities like the ones given to me and my family and many of your families, are available for individuals and families. All over this state and all over this country, who are seeking opportunities simply for a better life. Instead of addressing the fundamental issues with our immigration system, the president-elect would ignore them by literally Walling our country off from the rest of the world. By banning the practitioners of one of the world's largest faiths. We would tell the world and ourselves, the very freedom of religion is up for debate in the Unites States of America. We cannot allow and legitimize profiling and discrimination based on race or religion. It was wrong before the presidential election, and it is wrong today. Lets promote inclusion and solidarity, opportunity and equity, rather than wasting billions of dollars scapegoating those simply pursuing the American dream. I respectfully ask for you aye vote on HR 4.\n",

      "\tThank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I also rise in strong support of HR 4. I also stand before you as the granddaughter of immigrants. Most everybody in this chamber comes from immigrant stock and while we all know that the President hasn't taken office yet, we all lived through the election. We all heard the threats. We all heard the vitriol. We all felt the fear in our communities that people faced when they heard the threats. So, while we stand here today, we don't know what policies, since they seem to change every day, might be implemented, but, I don't know about you, but I was raised on a foundation of trust and that my word was my bond and when I said something, I would go to all means possible to maintain the integrity of my word. And so, we have to trust that what we heard during the campaign might come true and so, we stand here before you today as Californians, to say our word is our bond and we say that all people were created equal and in the State of California will be treated that way and that we stand with our word. Pledging to Californians, pledging to the rest of the country, that equity, equality, diversity, immigrants are people that we value, they are us and I respectfully ask for your aye vote on HR 4.\n",
      "[00:11:57] Kevin Mullin: \n",
      "\tThank you Dr. Eggman. Mr. Chavez, you are recognized at your desk.\n",
      "[00:12:05] Rocky Chavez: \n",
      "\tYes, members, this whole discussion right now saddens me in a number of ways. For a point of history on this issue of immigration, in 2013 we had a number of bills, AJR 3, HJR 8, and I supported those. In 2015, we had SJR 2, run by the Republicans actually, Senator Vidak. And I spoke and supported that also because we know that the history of California is one that relies heavily on immigrants and so, we all noticed that there was a problem within our country and it needed to be dealt with. To capture off a statement somebody made earlier, the first step on boxing is to figure out how you are stance. I would say that we are setting a standard going forward right now. That I think when we start looking on it on health care, on education, on energy, and on emigration. And all very serious issues that need to be discussed in a very thoughtful way, running something through in a very short notice, I would say is probably not the most thoughtful way to do that. Justice is a flower, but justice and a flower need to be measured and taken care from more from the center of division. When you take the position that California's in a fight, I disagree with that. California's a very strong economy in the world. We are the strongest economy in the United States. When we take a modest, thoughtful position through our own actions, others will see, and from that we will lead, but to throw down a gauntlet and say, here we go, without ever having the time for us to discuss this. It's not the right thing to do. Think about it. Would it not have been nice for this issue that we're talking about immigration, if it would have been bipartisan with both Republican and Democrat leaderships signed onto this? I would have been more than happy to sign on to this, but not to be rammed through us in a very forceful way. Ladies and gentlemen, we are setting the stance. I don't think it's best for us for California to think we're in a fight. I think we need strong, quiet leaders leading with our actions instead of throwing gauntlets down and saying, I'm going to fight. Justice is a flower and needs to be protected. We need to protect the image of the State of California.\n",

This is certainly a true honor for me to serve on this great state Legislature. Today, I was expecting very joyous Celebration of my inauguration with my family members. Next to me my wife stepped out and my daughter, and my sister's family, the gallery, and all my members and other colleagues here. It's quite interesting, at the same time very disappointing. On the first day, why such a controversial resolution? And now HR 4 has been introduced and the tone of the voice is very defiant, and we're going to fight the federal government even before our President has been sworn in. I thought that we are the Untied States of America, working together and we need to support the President of the United States, when he's sworn in. We don't even know what the President is going to introduce a bill and the Congress will act upon and even before any action has been proposed, this body at the California State Legislature is announcing, hey, we are announcing the fight against you. The federal government. What a sad day. I thought that this day would be the day of a celebration and a joyous occasion, and to make friends, but it is just so confusing for me. I was not prepared as you heard. And also as I got the information only a couple hours ago. I was informed about this is going to happen. I hope all the members here Assembly will need to have more of a constructive cooperative spirit rather than divisive by the partisan lines. I am willing to work with all members of this body for the people of California. As an immigrant myself, why would I object any immigration policy that would be good for America? It is the country of immigration, country of immigrants. This country is so great because we accept and from the beginning this body, this country, has allowed immigrants from all over the world and given the opportunity, even myself, to serve at this state level of government, this is a true honor and anybody can achieve the American dream like I have. However we do not take blanket welcome at this day and age. We need to keep the integrity of this country, that's the reason we have border. We welcome immigrants, however through the process that this country has set up the rules and the regulations. Not to welcome anyone when we live in this unfortunate ever, that we have to fear our lives on a daily basis, of because of the terrorism not that we experience everyday, all over the world. So I think this immigration, the policy, we embrace is one thing, but how we embrace the immigration, that's very, very important. We need to have a proper time.\n",

I stand before you to ask for your support for HR 4. In todays political climate, it is important to remember that our nation is founded on principals of freedom and opportunity. We cannot abandon our immigrant brothers and sisters. We should remember that these people are like you and I parents and children. Ordinary people who have sacrificed so much just to be one step closer to achieving the American dream. We need a fair system that gives them the ability to obtain their dreams, whether it's through docker program or through an application for citizenship, these kinds of reforms need to be priority and for these reasons, I rise in support and ask you to support the measure as well and on behalf of the speaker, I am asking for co-authors on the resolution HR 4.\n",

      "\tThank you, Mr. Holden. Mr. Holden, on behalf of the speakers asking for co-authors on the resolution. Mr. Allen, you are recognized.\n",
      "[00:22:33] Travis Allen: \n",
      "\tThank you very much Mr. Speaker. First, I'd like to compliment my colleague for his incredible heartfelt speech, as a first generation immigrant. I would also like to say to my colleagues across the aisle, many of the points you made I think are actually very correct and we share those on both sides of the aisle. There's a difference however between immigrants and those who are here in our country illegally and with that in mind, I would like to first point out that this resolution like one of the other resolutions that we went through earlier today was written in the darkness of night. It was written with the intention of making a national statement on California's behalf, without any process, without any conversation, or without any transparency. HR 4, very simply is a politically self-serving attempt to cynically stoke fear and anxiety among Californians in the immigrant community, both legal and undocumented, that are living in our California population, which is in fact, the exact opposite of what its authors and its supporters are stating that they intend. Of course, we all agree that this is a nation of immigrants. Immigrants built America, their energy and inventiveness. The patriotism with which they have embraced the United States are contributions beyond measure. They, we have fought and died for American liberties and our way of life. We are all the fresh blood that keeps America young and renewed, but this resolution, HR 4, isn't about recognizing what no one is disputing. Instead, it's reckless demagoguery aimed at instilling fear and making immigrants needlessly anxious and fearful about their future. It is beneath the dignity of this body. Just a few days ago, President Elect Trump laid out a threefold approach to immigration on 60 Minutes. He said he would immediately seek to Deport all criminal, criminal illegal immigrants and once we have regained control over the flow of criminal immigration, then, and only then, would the federal government, after the proper amount of time, vetting, and discussion, would formulate a policy for the remaining undocumented population. Which, again, is something I think we all should agree on in this body. So I ask very simply, very clearly, does anyone in this chamber think the United States shouldn't be able to control the level of criminals coming into our country? We are indeed a nation of immigrants, millions and millions of immigrants all over the the course of two and a half centuries. My own family immigrated to this country. It's worth remembering that we all came here seeking to live freely in a nation of laws. Unbothered by arbitrary government that limited our freedom and opportunity. Unbothered from governments that sought to distract from failed policies by stoking fear. After reading his resolution, which again we've only held in our hands for a brief few hours and certainly not 72, I can not help that its politicized spirit has much in common with the nature of the regimes from which many of our immigrants have fled to America. If this body wants to demonstrate its care and concern for the many residents of this state who are immigrants, I suggest we spend our time enacting reforms that will spur job creation, economic opportunity, and upward mobility. Enacting reforms that give poor families, many of whom are immigrants, the opportunity to send their children to the school of their choice. Passing reforms that reduce income inequality by reducing taxes and expanding opportunities for working people to earn more money, keep it, take it home, and raise their families with. I suggest we take meaningful action to offer Californians, immigrants or not, hope and opportunity, rather than further dividing the state and instilling fear and anxiety because last month, members and family and anyone else who happens to be watching in the media that will be reporting on this, last month America spoke. Americans are tired of being ignored.\n",

      "\tOrdinary hard working Americans across the country and in California stood up because they were tired of business as usual. They were tired of being buried under the political agendas of the establishment and yet here we are ignoring the very real needs of our California residents. By the way, California not only has the highest tax in the nation, we have the highest poverty rate in the nation. These are real issues. We are ignoring these issues that all of our constituents voted to have us address. I stand here today to tell you that our people are not political props. Our hardworking California citizens will not be silence, and our Legislature shall not stand and should not stand for divisive political ploys like the one being made here today. I urge a no vote on HR 4.\n",

      "\tThank you, Mr. Speaker and members. I rise in support of HR 4. This resolution is not about partisan politics, and it need not be. It simply is an opportunity to heal hurts that many in California have experienced because of words. It's been stated here today that just because a candidate for an office has made statements, that that does not necessarily translate to policy, but we all know or we're always taught that our words matter, and when you utter them, they have force, and they have great force when those words come from the person who stands to be the leader of the free world. It is a fact that right now, there are children in our state who are afraid to go to school because of things that they have heard, because of statements that they have heard made in the course of electing a President. Statements that they have heard that have caused them to believe that their families would be split up, that their families would be harmed. This resolution simply calls on our Federal government, President, and Congress to say that we are all the citizens of this great nation and that California has been a leader in creating reasonable and rational immigration and that federal government must do the same. Many of you have heard me say how I've been the only person in my family's history to ever serve in any elected office. I'd often said, as many of you had, that we stand on the shoulders of those who come before us and in my case, on the shoulder of my grandparents, who were immigrants. And had they not had the opportunity to become naturalized citizens, I, like many of you, would not have the opportunity to serve in this great chamber. My maternal grandmother was born in Columbia and immigrated to Panama and ultimately to the United States. My maternal grandfather was born in Jamaica and immigrated to Panama and ultimately to the United States. My mother, my cousin who raised me, all born in Panama, all naturalized citizens who love this country and love what this country stands for, creating opportunity and humanity in the place of fear and injustice and we must continue to uplift those traditions. This state has led in ways that have our state stronger and safer and have built our economy. We provided healthcare for all, regardless of citizenship, because we know that when people don't have access to healthcare, healthcare costs go up, when you go to the emergency room to be seen for things that could be treated in other ways. This state has spent more money to allow citizens to become, those who are not yet citizens, to become naturalized citizens. We know that that strengthens families. It actually brings dollars to our state, so please don't be fooled. This bill is not about partisan politics. This bill is simply saying we must provide healing for the hurt that has been caused by the words of those who have uttered them and calls on our federal government to create a path of citizenship to create responsible and reasonable immigration, to push back on hate and intolerance, to promote humanity, and to make our state stronger, safer, and more important in this nation.

We need to ensure that there is fairness, not just for everyone in California, but also how we operate right here in this house. Now, we just passed, the voters of this state just passed Proposition 54, where they made very clear that they wanted transparency in how we do business. They made very clear, that they wanted bills to be in print for 72 hours before we vote on them. And these rules that we're about to adopt exempt constitutional amendments from those rules, as well as other exemptions that are not consistent with what the voters just approved. Now, we just took an oath, swearing allegiance to the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of California. If we take that oath seriously, then I think we should think about how these rules that we're about to adopt are consistent with that and allowing the people to see what we're doing on constitutional amendments, allowing the people to have that 72 hours to speak to our rules, to speak to these amendments that are going to be proposed. If we don't have clear and consistent rules, we don't have equality. If the rules only apply in certain circumstances, we don't have equality. So let's not undermine all of the platitudes that we just talked about today by adopting rules that clearly don't do that. And I think we should postpone it and make sure that these rules are fair for all of us. So I ask for your no vote today, thank you.\n",

      "[00:23:57] Travis Allen: \n",
      "\tThank you, Mr. Speaker. I'd like to echo the comments of the previous member that spoke. In this recent election, we saw Californians vote resoundingly for more transparency in this body, in the California State Legislature, with the passage of Proposition 54. To everyone that is watching this today, not only the members here and our families, but all California, these rules before us were written with the intention of undoing our wishes as California residents and without vetting, without giving us 72 hours to review and no open discussion to pass rules that many of us have not even read. This comes after the people of California have overwhelmingly and clearly voted for more transparency. So points that we should acknowledge about this particular bill, HR 1, is exactly what it will do. AR 11 adds a Committee called Communications and Conveyance. There is no description of what this Committee's responsible for. AR 32 changes the responsibility of Committee preference of members from the chief clerk to the speaker. AR 49 enables each member to introduce 50 bills instead of the current limit of 40 bills. I would imagine there is increased taxpayer expense at that. AR 69 enables a bill amended to add co-authors to be taken up without a copy of the bill being placed on members desks over the objection of the Republican leader. This was formerly both the speaker and the minority leader would have to approve. In addition, it exempts amendments to constitutional amendments from the 5:00 PM deadline for submitting amendments to the Chief Clerk. It exempts amendments to constitutional amendments from having an analysis prepared by the Chief Clerk, or having that analysis provided to member prior to the beginning of any debate, which is a change in the implementation of Proposition 54. And although we consistently argue for more transparency, with HR 1 we are also voting to exempt joint and concurrent resolutions, along with constitutional amendments, from following in the 72 hour publication rule from Senate bills under AR 76. And that would be the proper implementation of Proposition 54. Simply put, members, this bill's problematic. This bill is likely unconstitutional and will be challenged in court, and it is has certainly not been properly vetted by us, members of the public, or members of the press. I urge a no vote.\n",

Families will often come together again and again. Not long ago a teenage boy said to me after losing his grandmother, I've attended our annual holiday family gatherings as if they were an obligation, maybe even a chore, but after losing grandma, I know that our family gatherings will never be the same. I said to him, you honor your grandmother with your tears, for they are your tears of love and she has earned them. And now you, at your young age, you know what we will all learn again and again in living life. It is this. If there is one who has shown us kindness, let us thank them now. If there is someone we love, let us hold them close now and let us not take for granted, even one opportunity, to be with those whose lives give meaning to our own. For we are here today because of them. Today as we open this new term of the California State Assembly, let us remember that we are here today because of the loving support and sacrifices of so many others and during this very special family time of year, let us not take for granted the people who's lives, whose efforts and sacrifices allow us to be here today.

As a member of committees, especially the Budget Committee I have been part of a thorough and open process that let us dig deeper into the issues. As the Representative for the 44th Assembly District, I know that the speaker respects the votes I cast for my district and my conscience and I know I'm not alone. I believe every returning member, regardless of party or length of service could easily associate themselves with any of the remarks that I have just made. Members, this is the first session of the Assembly that has convened where the entire membership is under new term limits. One of the defining factors of this era will be the power of continuity and the benefits that our continuity bring to us as Assembly members and to our constituents.

As someone who is committed to advancing the quality of education in California, it is important to me that a passion for education is what brought Anthony Rendon to Sacramento. From securing additional funding for early childhood education in the budget to restoring funding for K through 12 and community colleges, and increasing opportunities for California students at the UC, and CSU. Speaker Rendon has turned that passion into real progress. As a former member of the Santa Barbara Commission for Women, I value how supportive Speaker Rendon has been to the women's caucus and their legislative priorities. I applaud his commitment to continue to empower women members and staff. As the representative of some of California's finest environmental treasurers, I appreciate the leadership Speaker Rendon has shown in helping win support for significant legislation on the environment and public health. His commitment to ensuring that people of color both have greater access to our environmental resources and more the hand in shaping environmental policies is already paying dividends. As a new member in the Assembly, I am proud that one of my very first acts is to help nominate Assembly member Anthony Rendon for another term as speaker.\n",

      "[00:22:11] Shirley Weber: \n",
      "\tMembers I too rise today and join my colleagues from Torrance and Santa Barbara in seconding the nomination of Assemblymember Anthony Rendon for speaker of the California State Assembly. Speaker Rendon is a person who has built his life around the challenge of justice, as a philosopher as well as an advocate and activist in communities. We all often hear the phrase Learned from King when he use the quote that the arc of the moral universe is long, which means it's long and difficult and tedious. Yet, it always been toward justice and that has been Anthony Rendon's call, the call to justice and he's asked us consistently, what is just? What is justice that we as a house must address? And we learned very quickly that he not only understands what it is from an academic point of view as a philosopher himself by training, but he understands the plight of those who struggle for justice each and every day in his own personal life. He understands what the question is, what is justice. Is it just for LA to have a river that is so beautiful in the north in the affluent community. And yet, when it seems as if it crosses a Mason-Dixon line, it becomes ugly and corrupt and unable to meet the needs of the people of the City of Los Angeles and the county. He asked the question of what is justice when we talk about drinking water for all children in schools and should not all of our schools have the kind of infrastructure that provides our children with the necessary element of clean drinking water in their schools. He asked the question about what is just in a state as beautiful as California that cannot provide adequate water for all of its citizens and water that we take for granted is not found in certain communities. He asked a question about what is just when we talk about immigration and we talk about those who live in this state who provide so many opportunities for so many. Is it just that there is a separate system for them in terms of equal opportunity and access? Is it just to have a state so wealthy and yet so poor at the same time? Is that justice? And so Anthony Rendon has asked us the question of justice and that's an important question that we have to answer and as we face this new year, the session of 2016-17. And we just finished an election that has probably rocked all of us to the core. We realize that we're going to be faced with that questions of many, many generations. What is just? What is fair? What is honest? And this house has addressed those issues in the past. We've addressed the issues of justice because it was somehow convenient for us to do that, but now we will have the real challenge of what we really mean by justice and what better than to have a leader, who has spent his life fighting for justice for each and every person, than Anthony Rendon. We've been a leader in the areas of justice for environmental justice. We've been a leader in the area of criminal reform in terms of justice in what we're attempting to do. We've been a leader in terms of providing opportunity and access for immigrants to education in the area of justice. So we have established ourselves as the leader in this nation for justice as a state. We will be challenged in the future to determine whether or not we really believe that, whether that's a part of our core values, will we continue to fight for justice? What better thing than to have a speaker who has spent his life fighting for justice. Most of you know that I often ask to say that we as a nation talk about the things that are important, in terms of inclusion, and justice, and freedom and I always tell you that justice is a rare flower that needs to be constantly pruned, and nurtured, and given sunshine and water to make it grow, but injustice is a weed that grows best in neglect. What better than to have our own horticulturist, in terms of justice, in our speaker, Anthony Rendon. I am proud to second the nomination for the 70th speaker of this house to be Anthony Rendon.\n",

      "\tThank you, I rise to nominate Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mays for Speaker of the Assembly. As a member of the Republican Assembly, I think those of you have served with us these last few years have seen that Mr. Mayes is color-blind when it comes to dealing with some of the issues that we face in California, when it comes to issues of transportation, when it comes to issues of immigration, of education, of the water issues. All of the things that the previous speakers commented on in their nomination for Speaker Rendon. These are the same issues that Assemblyman Mayes has also addressed in a thoughtful way, in a contemplative way, and in an inclusive way. In a way that doesn't shut certain groups or certain demographics out of the conversation, but invites them in. So I would ask that the nomination today from myself goes to Assemblyman Chad Mayes, thank you.\n",

      "\tThank you very much. Thank you. Well, good afternoon. Members, thank you for putting your faith in me. This is an honor I am proud to accept and will work diligently to earn. Honored guests, friends and family, ordinarily, this a day when speakers offer pleasantries and plans for the year ahead. But this is no ordinary time. And I would be remiss in my responsibility to this House, to the people I represent, and to my conscience if I did not acknowledge that. Members, 75 years ago, this week, the United States was drawn into World War II. That war was an existential threat against this nation's people and it's principles. We have faced other threats in these past 75 years. The Cold War and nuclear proliferation, the turmoil of the 1960s. The betrayal of Watergate and now climate change. These past 75 years have also seen us make important progress in civil rights, environmental protection, public health, and social justice. At this moment, I believe our nation is facing another major existential threat. And a threat to the progress that we have attained. Californians may accept the lawfulness of the November election. But millions of us do not accept the sentiment delivered by this election. And it is up to us in this body to pass policies that would firewall Californians and what we believe from the cynical, shortsighted, and reactionary agenda that is rising in the wake of this election. White nationalists and anti-Semites have no business working in the White House. And the Justice Department of the United States has no business working to dismantle the voting rights, the civil rights, the equal rights, and the reproductive rights of the American people. In August of 1988 President Ronald Reagan apologized to Japanese-Americans for their internment by saying, here we admit a wrong. Here we reaffirm our commitment to equal justice under the law. Yet, rather than echoing that commitment to equal justice, the next administration has talked about internment camps as a justification for offensive policies. In a speech she made in 1940, with an eye toward the looming war, Eleanor Roosevelt said this: We cannot tell from day to day what may come. This is no ordinary time. No time for weighing anything except what we can do best for the country as a whole. And that responsibility rests on each and every one of us as individuals. That is the responsibility we accepted when we swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of California against all enemies. All foreign enemies and all domestic enemies. Californians should be wary of the national calls for unity and healing. Unity must be separated from complicity. And we must be defiant whenever justice, fairness, and righteousness require. Californians do not need healing. We need to fight. We need to fight to protect our economy and its growth. We need to fight to protect our people and their rights. The Assembly and the Senate will work side by side to shrine into existing laws protections for all Californians. We will be saying loud and clear, if you are a woman, your rights are enforced here in California. If you need healthcare coverage, we will do all we can so you can find it here in California. If you are Muslim or LGBT or anyone whose rights and safety are increasingly under fire, you are equal, at least here in California. And with HR 4 today we are saying that if you are an immigrant You are welcome here in California. In short, California will be saying, in the defiant words of Winston Churchill, today, we may say aloud before an awe struck world, we are still masters of our fate, we are still captains of our souls. Others speak of their identity but we too, have an identity in California. We have an identity of inclusion, and we will do whatever we can to protect that identity. Of course, the potential threats from the new administration are not the only struggles we face as Californians. There are homegrown challenges as well. A transportation system that is overcrowding and crumbling, housing costs so high that families can't make ends, and teachers and police officers can't afford to work where they live. We tried to address these issues in the last session. We made some progress, but we did not succeed. And that is a mark on what was otherwise a tremendous session. Members, we have no choice but to solve the housing and transportation crisis in the term ahead. These crises affect each and every one of us, and those in our districts. If we don't step up and solve them, our economy will decline, and the people we represent will suffer. This house has solved tough challenges before. That's why California's in the strong economic shape that we're in. We just said goodbye to the Assembly class of 2010. When they were sworn in, they faced having to close a $26 billion budget deficit, a deficit that would have been much lower, were it not for the first act taken by an inexperienced celebrity Governor seven years before. Thanks to smart decisions and tough choices by voters, the Legislature, and an experienced Governor, we've turned things around. We increased funding for public schools and community colleges by roughly 50% over the past five years. And we've increased funding for other higher education institutions as well, that we must continue to do more. We have, as the Legislative Analyst projects, strong multi-billion dollar structural balances into the future. We have a debt ratio on track to drop below 5% and a robust rainy day fund that takes us off the cycle of boom and bust. And we have, as the LAO also notes, the ability to withstand a recession like the 2001 downturn, without the need for service cuts, or middle class tax increases. While the budget has mainly been driven by Democrats, since voters restored that ability, there are areas where the Assembly has achieved bipartisan success as well. Looking out at the faces before me, I am optimistic we can do the same again, especially on housing and transportation, which have historically been bipartisan issues. Finally, I would like to note that today we welcome new members. We welcome returning members, and we welcome some newly returning members. Farmers and teachers, veterans and first responders, prosecutors and public defenders, scientists and small business owners, all of us sent here to represent our districts, to make laws. And equally important, to perform the oversight in order to make sure that those laws are carried out in the best interests of the people of California. It is increasingly apparent that those interests will not be a concern for the next President, nor for the bullies, bigots and billionaires that he has chosen for his cabinet, or for the majority in Congress that is already salivating at the prospect of ending Medicare. It is up to us to look after the interests of the people of California. Whether you actively work to oppose the next President, or stayed silent, hoping he would go away, it is now up to all of us to preserve California and protect its people. Members, this is no ordinary time and it will require and extraordinary effort from each of us. We are here to do the people's business, and we can't allow it to be business as usual. Thank you. Members and guests, we are joined many esteemed guests this session. We have the honor of receiving the oath of office from the honorable Mariano Florentino Cuellar, Associate Justice for Supreme Court. From the US House of Representatives are the honorable Xavier Becerra, the 34th Congressional District. We would also like to welcome our Constitutional Officers. Lieutenant Governor, the Honourable Gavin Newsom. Secretary of State, the Honorable Alex Padilla. Insurance Commissioner, the Honorable Dave Jones. From the Board of Equalization, the Board Chair, welcome the Honorable Fiona Ma. Also from the Board of Equalization, the Honorable Diane Harkey. Great, we have some former Speakers here as well. Once a Speaker, always a Speaker, I should say. My predecessors for the office of Assembly Speaker, the 60 second speaker, the Honorable Cruz Bustamante. We had in the chamber earlier the 66th speaker, the Honorable Fabian Nez. The 68th speaker, the honorable, John A Perez. We also welcome several representatives of other countries and governments, former members and Legislature, other distinguished public officials and special guests who have all joined us here today. Thank you. Our next order of business is the appointment of the Speaker pro tem. I am appointing Kevin Mullin to this office and a Select Committee to escort him to the rostrum.
